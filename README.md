## Introduction

### Goal
In this assignment, we are required to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodoversity Dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
